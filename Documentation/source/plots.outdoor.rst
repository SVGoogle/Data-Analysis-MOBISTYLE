Outdoor climate
===============

In order to evaluate the IAQ and more accurately make a comparison between BASELINE and MOBISTYLE period, first the influence of the outdoor climate must be evaluated.
Parameters like outdoor air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation is obtained from the  weather station in Slovenia, Ljubljana.
Heating degree-days (HDD) and cooling-degreedays (CDD) are used to compare heating and cooling demands of the respective monitoring period.
