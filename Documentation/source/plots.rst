Indoor climate
==============

The main purpose of this data analysis is to compare Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) at the office rooms and observe if the office employees have changed their behavior due to the MOBISTYLE project over the lenght of 2 years.

Monitoring periods in figures have the following meaning:

#. MOBISTYLE - employees exposed to MOBISTYLE :ref:`ict-solutions`.

#. BASELINE - no intervention

See table :ref:`room-info` for a more detailed information about the room and ICT solution implementation dates.
